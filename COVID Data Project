For this project I imported and queried data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

#Probability of death if positive for COVID in your country.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths::decimal/total_cases)*100 as death_percentage
FROM covid_deaths

#Probability of death if positive for COVID in the United States.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths::decimal/total_cases)*100 as death_percentage
FROM covid_deaths
WHERE location = 'United States'
