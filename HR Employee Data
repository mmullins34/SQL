For this project, I extracted data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmldas/hr-employee-data-descriptive-analytics/discussion, transformed/cleansed the data, and imported it into postgreSQL

#Total number of employees.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_data

#Total numbers of employees in sales department.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_data
WHERE department = 'sales'

#Names of distinct departments throughout the company.
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employee_data
WHERE department IS NOT NULL

#Number of work accidents.
SELECT COUNT(work_accident) FROM employee_data
WHERE work_accident = 1

#Number of employees who were promoted and left the company.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_data
WHERE left_company = 1 AND promotion_last_5years = 1

#Total number of employees with the greatest amount of projects.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee_data
WHERE number_of_projects = 7

#Total number of employees with the greatest amount of projects and satisfaction level greater than 75%.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee_data
WHERE number_of_projects = 7 AND satisfaction_level > 0.75

#Total number of employees with the least amount of projects and satisfaction level greater than 75%.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee_data
WHERE number_of_projects = 2 AND satisfaction_level > 0.75

#Total number of employees who left the company and had a satisfaction level lower than 75%.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee_data
WHERE left_company = 1 AND satisfaction_level < 0.75
