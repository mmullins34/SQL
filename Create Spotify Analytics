# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the Top 10 tracks by popularity.
SELECT track_name, popularity FROM spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90
GROUP by track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Second I determined the longest song by duration.
SELECT track_name, duration_ms FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Then I determined the average duration of the songs listed.
SELECT AVG(duration_ms) AS average_song_duration
FROM spotifydata;

#Lastly, I determined which artist had the most "danceable" song.
SELECT artist_name FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 1;
