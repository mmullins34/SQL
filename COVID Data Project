For this project I imported and queried data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

#Probability of death if positive for COVID in your country.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths::decimal/total_cases)*100 as death_percentage
FROM covid_deaths

#Probability of death if positive for COVID in the United States.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths::decimal/total_cases)*100 as death_percentage
FROM covid_deaths
WHERE location = 'United States'

#Percentage of people who tested positive for COVID in the United States.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases::decimal/population)*100 as percentageofcovid
FROM covid_deaths
WHERE location = 'United States'

#Countries with highest infection rate compared to population.
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) as highestinfectioncount, MAX((total_cases::decimal/population))*100 as percentageofpopulationinfected
FROM covid_deaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY percentageofpopulationinfected DESC NULLS LAST
