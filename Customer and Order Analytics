FROM customers

FROM jansales
GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

FROM febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
